<h2>#<a name="1"></a> What affect does Carer's Allowance have on the person you care for?</h2>

<p>The person you are looking after may be getting extra money with their benefit if they are severely disabled and getting any of the following benefits :</p>
<ul>
<li>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance</li>
<li>Income Support</li>
<li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
<li>Pension Credit
Housing Benefit</li>
</ul>
<p>This extra money is called <em>severe disability premium or the addition for severe disability</em>.</p>
<p>If you are paid Carer's Allowance for looking after them, this extra money will stop. The person you are looking after cannot get severe disability premium if you are getting Carer's Allowance.</p>
<p>This could also affect any reduction in Council Tax they may be entitled to. To find out more about it, please contact the Local Authority.</p>
<p>If you have only underlying entitlement to Carer's Allowance and are not actually paid it, the person you look after will still get any extra money they are entitled to.</p>
<p>Underlying entitlement means you are entitled to Carer's Allowance but it is not paid because you get another benefit or entitlement that is as much as or more than Carer's Allowance.</p>

<p>See <a href="#15">Where to get help and advice</a> for where to get advice about this.</p>



<!-- / -->



<h2># When to claim from?</h2>

<p>Entitlement to Carer's Allowance can be backdated for up to 3 months. Claim from the date caring began.</p>
<p>If you do not claim Carer's Allowance within 3 months of the decision to pay the person you care for Personal Independence Payment, Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance, Constant Attendance Allowance or Armed Forces Independence Payment you may lose money.</p>


<p> -- CONTENT REQUIRED (exceptional circumstances) -- </p>


<!-- / -->


<h2># How payments work?</h2>
<p>We can pay Carer's Allowance every week, or every four weeks. This is normally be paid on Monday.</p>

<p>If you are paid every 4 weeks this is made up of 3 weeks in arrears and 1 week in advance. If you are paid every week this is 1 week in advance.</p>

<p><strong>We normally pay your money into an account.</strong>
Many banks and building societies will let you collect your money
at the post office.</p>
<p>We will tell you when we will make the first payment and how
much it will be for. We will tell you if the amount we pay into the
account is going to change.</p>
<p><strong>Finding out how much we have paid into the account</strong>
You can check your payments on account statements. The
statements may show your National Insurance (NI) number next to
any payments we have made. If you think a payment is wrong, get
in touch with the Carer's Allowance Unit straight away.</p>
<p><strong>If we pay you too much money</strong>
We have the right to take back any money we pay that you are not
entitled to. This may be because of the way the system works for
payments into an account.
For example, you may give us some information, which means you
are entitled to less money. Sometimes we may not be able to
change the amount we have already paid you. This means we will
have paid you money that you are not entitled to.
<strong>We will contact you before we take back any money.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About the account you want to use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can use an <strong>account in your name</strong>, or a <strong>joint account.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>A Post Office card account can only be in <strong>your name</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can use <strong>someone else's account</strong> if:</p>
</li>
<li><p>the terms and conditions of their account allow this, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>they agree to let you use their account, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>you are sure they will use your money in the way you tell them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can use a <strong>credit union account</strong>. You must tell us the credit union's account details. Your credit union will be able to help you with this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are an <strong>appointee</strong> or a <strong>legal representative</strong> acting on behalf of the customer, the account should be in your name only.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2># How does Carer's Allowance work with other benefits?</h2>
<p>As well as getting Carer's Allowance, you might be able to get other benefits. If you or your partner already get any other benefits or entitlements, you should still claim Carer's Allowance. If the amount of benefit you get is less than the amount of Carer's Allowance you could get, we will pay you the difference.</p>


<p>If you get Carer's Allowance or have <strong>underlying entitlement</strong> you may get an extra amount from either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pension Credit - called the extra amount for caring</li>
<li>Income based Jobseeker's Allowance - called Carer Premium</li>
<li>Income Support - called Carer Premium</li>
<li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance - called Carer Premium</li>
<li>Universal Credit carer element</li>
</ul>

<p>Underlying entitlement means you are entitled to Carer's Allowance but it is not paid because you get another benefit or entitlement that is as much as or more than Carer's Allowance.</p>


<p>If you are getting Housing Benefit or a reduction in your Council Tax the Carer Premium may be included when the local authority work out how much benefit you can get. You must tell the office that pays your Housing Benefit or the local authority, if there is a reduction in your Council Tax, about the dates that you have entitlement or underlying entitlement to Carer's Allowance in order to get extra help.</p>
<p>If someone is getting extra money for you with their benefit, this extra money will stop or reduce if you are paid Carer's Allowance.</p>
<p><strong>If you put off claiming your State Pension</strong></p>
<p>Putting off claiming your State Pension is also known as State Pension deferral. Days for which you are paid Carer's Allowance will not count towards extra State Pension or the lump sum payment you could get when you do claim your State Pension.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the effect of getting Carer's Allowance while deferring your State Pension, please contact the Pension Service or get their detailed guide about State Pension deferral. You can get a copy from their website. The address is <a href="http://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension">www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension</a>.</p>


<p>If someone is getting any of the benefits shown above, and these include extra money for you, we will arrange for the extra money to stop or reduce. We will then pay the Carer's Allowance to you.</p>
<p>If you get any Widow's Benefit or Bereavement Benefits, claim Carer's Allowance anyway because we may be able to give you National Insurance (NI) contribution credits. There is more about NI contribution credits in the next section.</p>


<!--


<h2># How do National Insurance (NI) contributions work</strong></p>
<p>Every week we pay you Carer's Allowance we will add a Class 1 NI contribution credit to your NI record. We will also normally give you a Class 1 NI contribution credit for any week when you are entitled to Carer's Allowance but we do not pay you because you are also getting Widow's Benefits or Bereavement Benefits at the same or higher weekly rate as your Carer's Allowance.</p>
<p>These Class 1 NI contribution credits may help you to get the basic rate of other benefits or entitlements in the future.</p>
<p>You will not get a Class 1 NI contribution credit with your</p>
<p>Carer's Allowance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if you are already getting Class 1 NI contribution credits with another benefit. For example, you may be getting contribution credits with your Incapacity Benefit or Employment and Support Allowance.</p>
</li>

<li><p>if you are a married woman who has elected to pay reduced-rate contributions when in work. See <a href="#14">Carer's Credit</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>State Second Pension</strong></p>
<p>For each week that we pay you Carer's Allowance, and for some periods before your Carer's Allowance begins and ends, you will automatically build up extra pension called State Second Pension. This is sometimes called 'additional pension'. If we do not pay your Carer's Allowance because you are getting other benefits or entitlements at the same or higher weekly rate, you will still build up State Second Pension. The extra pension will be paid with your basic State Pension when you reach state pension age.</p>
<p><strong>If someone else is also looking after the same person</strong></p>
<p>If someone else is also looking after the same person as you are, only one of you can get Carer's Allowance. Two people cannot get Carer's Allowance at the same time for looking after the same person. You must decide between you who is going to claim it.</p>
<p><strong>If you look after more than one person</strong></p>
<p>We will only pay you Carer's Allowance once each week even if you look after more than one person.</p>
<p><strong>The time you spend looking after someone</strong></p>
<p>If you stop looking after the person for a short time, you may still get Carer's Allowance.</p>
<p>For example, you may be able to get Carer's Allowance if you, or the person you look after, go into hospital or somewhere like that.</p>
<p>You must tell us straight away about any week when you look after someone for less than 35 hours.</p>
<p>By <em>week</em> we mean from the start of a Sunday to the end of the next Saturday.</p>

<h2># [Breaks from caring section]</h2>

<p><strong>Carer's Credit</strong></h2>
<p>National Insurance credits for carers of working age can automatically protect your future entitlement to the basic elements of the State Pension and Bereavement Benefits when Carer's Allowance is not being paid for any reason. The credit may also help you to build up some additional pension, sometimes called State Second Pension. Any additional pension you are entitled to will be paid with your basic State Pension when you claim it.
Carer's Credit will cover periods of up to 12 weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before your Carer's Allowance entitlement begins</li>
<li>During any breaks in care</li>
<li>At the end of any period of Carer's Allowance entitlement</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a married woman paying reduced rate NI contributions, we cannot give you Class 1 NI contribution credits for each week you are paid Carer's Allowance. However, you will receive Carer's Credit for each week you are entitled to Carer's Allowance in addition to the 12-week periods described above.
If you are not entitled to Carer's Allowance, or it has ended but you are providing care for one or more people for a total of 20 hours or more each week, you may be able to get Carer's Credit.
