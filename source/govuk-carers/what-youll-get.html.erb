	<header><h1>2. What you need to know</h1></header>
	        
	<h2>What you can get</h2>
	<p>You can get £59.75 a week Carer’s Allowance.</p>
	<p>You can only get Carer's Allowance for 1 person, even if you look after more people. If someone else is looking after the same person as you, you can't both get Carer’s Allowance.</p>
	<p>You may also be able to claim other benefits, eg an income-related benefit or Pension Credit.</p>
<!--	
	<div class="application-notice info-notice">
		<p>Use the <a href="/benefits-adviser">benefits adviser</a> to work out how much you can get and if your other benefits will be affected.</p>
	</div>
-->	
<h2>When to claim</h2>

<p>You can claim Carer's Allowance as soon as the person you care for has been awarded one of the benefits listed in <a href="eligibility.html">eligibility</a>. Claims can normally be backdated for up to 3 months but in some circumstances this can be longer.</p>

	<h2>Effect on your other benefits</h2>	
	<div class="application-notice info-notice">
		<p>A new benefit called <a href="/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a> started to be introduced in some areas of the country from 29 April 2013. If you get Universal Credit, it might affect how much you get from other benefits.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Any means-tested benefits you get will be reduced by the same amount you get from Carer’s Allowance. This includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Housing Benefit</li>
		<li>Income Support</li>
		<li>Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
		<li>Pension Credit</li>
		 <li>Universal Credit</li>
	</ul>
	<p>An extra amount (called the ‘carer premium’) will be included in the calculation of your means-tested benefits.</p>
	
	<p>You might also be eligible for a <a href="/council-tax-reduction">Council Tax Reduction</a>.</p>
	
	<div class="application-notice info-notice">
		<p>The <a href="/benefit-cap">benefit cap</a> limits the amount of benefit that most people aged 16 to 64 can get. Some individual benefits aren’t affected, but it may affect the total amount of benefit you get.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Effect on your partner's benefits</h2>
	<p>Some benefits your partner might get can also be affected if you receive Carer's Allowance.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Effect on the benefits of the person you care for</h2>
	<p>Carer’s Allowance can affect the benefits of the person you care for, if they get a severe disability premium with with any of these benefits:</p><ul>
	<li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
	  <li>Income Support</li>
	  <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
	  <li>Pension Credit </li>
	  <li>Housing Benefit</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Their <a href="/disability-premiums-income-support/overview">severe disability premium</a> will stop if you get Carer’s Allowance for looking after them. It can also affect their Council Tax reduction. Contact your <a href="/find-your-local-council">local council</a> to find out if this affects them.</p>
	
	<h2>Underlying entitlement</h2>	
	<p>You can’t normally get 2 income-replacement benefits (eg Carer’s Allowance and the State Pension) paid together. </p>
	<p>This is called the ‘overlapping benefit rule’. If you can’t be paid Carer’s Allowance because of this rule, you have ‘underlying entitlement’ to Carer’s Allowance instead.</p>
	
	<p>This might mean you could get:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the carer premiums in Jobseeker’s Allowance and Income Support</li>
		<li>the extra amount for carers in Pension Credit</li>
		<li>the carer element in Universal Credit</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>National Insurance contributions</h2>
	<p>Usually, for each week you get Carer’s Allowance or have an underlying entitlement you also get: </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="/boost-state-pension">National Insurance credits</a>  </li>
	  <li>contributions to your <a href="/additional-state-pension">Additional State Pension</a> </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Credits help to fill in any gaps in your National Insurance record. This can mean that you’ll still get the full State Pension and other benefits. </p>
	<p>These credits generally stop in the tax year you reach State Pension age, or if you have an underlying entitlement and get Widow’s Benefit or Bereavement Benefit.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>How you’re paid</h2>
	<p>You can choose to be paid every week, or every 4 weeks. </p>
	<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid">into an account</a>, eg your bank account.</p>
